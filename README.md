# webpack-vanilla-starter-kit
A nice and simple webpack configuration to serve as a starting point for your projects. Cache busting, minification, dev-server and other useful features are all pre-configured out of the box.

# Installation
run "npm install" at project root.

# Usage
"npm start" launches a development server on port 8080 and opens it in the browser automatically. <br>
"npm run build" builds a "/dist" directory with your code bundles inside.
